phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don \\' t have it , or it will be ready later . per gisb , final scheduled numbers on epng , nng , and tw are reported at 9 : 00 am the following day ( ie . sunday final will be out at 9 am on mon . ) . prior to the transition from pg & e , we received our balance by 9 : 15 or 9 : 30 am . i realize that the transition has been difficult , they are never a cake walk , however , this type of information is crucial . further , they have not provided any final numbers for the month of april , we should at least be able to receive a \" best available \" number , and the interstate pipes , due to gisb , have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month . i submit that ena should not be held liable for payment of the $ 0 . 03 / day rate , as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement . if epgt plans to administer fees , then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis . we may want to check the terms of the agreement , and / or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of may .\\nthank you ,\\nmary'], ['ham', '4539.2001-05-14.farmer.ham.txt', 'Subject: fw

7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,\\nboth with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via\\nan ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca\\nadapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and\\nsirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .\\nthe bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in\\nsound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel\\nquality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more\\nchannels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .\\nafter careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have\\nsaid . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and\\nare streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its\\noft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm\\nhas an extra comedy channel ( it \\' s boring , and features older , censored\\ncomedy ) , and a few more \" experimental \" music channels which most will find\\ntotally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular\\n( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it \\' s\\nno wonder xm doesn \\' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you\\nbuy . also , xm \\' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .\\nthe greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are\\nthe staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the\\ncorporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying\\nin an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that\\nmakes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you \\' ve had it up\\nloud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .\\nthis , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my\\ncancelling xm .\\nxm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent\\nmusic and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept\\nxm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no\\nmatter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered\\neverything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the\\ntalk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the\\nuseful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .\\nxm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius\\nalso has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .\\nhowever , xm doesn \\' t have streaming audio on its website -

' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the\\nopportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip\\nservices over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution\\nrelationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the\\ncaribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,\\nceo and chairman of nomad international inc .\\nmay 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent\\nannouncement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications\\ncommission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol\\n( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone\\nservice .\\nin its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build\\nsustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers\\nwill not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to\\nstifle competition .\\nthe ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter\\nthe canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,\\ncable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the\\nmarket with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad\\ninternational inc .\\nthe key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its\\nproducts to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though\\nbroadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization\\nworldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the\\nu . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the\\ntotal users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only\\napproximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore\\nrepresents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .\\nthe percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even\\nhigher .\\nnomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service\\nproviders not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,\\nbut also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace\\nby offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .\\nabout nomad international inc .\\nnomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications\\ncompany developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over\\ninternet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip\\nproduct line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,\\ncable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on\\ntargeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in\\neffectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,\\n2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european\\npresence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in\\ntheir offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more\\neconomical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a\\nmeans of significantly lowering their communication expense with their\\nrelatives in their country of origin .\\nconclusion :\\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are\\nalready familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for\\nyou ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch\\nthis one trade monday !
